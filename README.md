These formul√¶ provide software providing Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities developed by the [DELPH-IN consortium](http://www.delph-in.net). These NLP packages provide various tools to assist in [HPSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_phrase_structure_grammar) driven natural language parsing and generation. See [this page](http://moin.delph-in.net/DelphinApplications) for a list of applications of these tools.
